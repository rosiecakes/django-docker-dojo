# üñ•Ô∏è Django Docker Dojo üéâ

## Introduction
Django Docker Dojo is a starter project for building a Dockerised, API-driven 
web application using Django, Django Rest Framework, PostgreSQL, Celery, 
Gunicorn & Nginx, served to a decoupled ReactJS front-end.

It's an intentionally simple starter project. Out of the box, it assumes a 
single database, a single application layer, and a single, de-coupled front-end,
although it could be fairly easily modified to handle a more complex 
architecture. Equally, it could be simplified by removing services that are 
surplus to requirements!

## Requirements
You'll need to install [Docker][] and [Docker-Compose][]. You'll want the most 
recent versions of both for your development machine. This system hasn't been 
tested on anything beyond Mac OS Catalina 10.15.6, but it's probably safe to 
assume it will work without issue on other modern Mac or Unix-based systems, 
although you might need to tweak it a little if you run into trouble. 
(It would be extremely surprising to me if it worked in any capacity on 
Windows environments.)

## The Build
This project builds what is essentially a multi-container Docker Compose 
configuration that sets up a number of containers, each based on an 
appropriate image. It includes:

- A [Django][] container, for the back-end application layer.
- A [Postgres][] container, for the database.
- An [NginX][] container as the reverse proxy & static fileserver. 
Static and media files are persisted in appropriate volumes within the 
container.
- We use [ReactJS][] on the front-end through a dedicated Node-based container.
- We use [Gunicorn][] to serve the Django application, through WSGI.
- We use [Celery][] to handle long-running (or scheduled) jobs.
- We use [Redis][] as the message queue for the Celery schedule.

### Other notes
- [Python][] dependencies are managed through [pipenv][], using `Pipfile` for 
requirements, and `Pipfile.lock` to lock dependencies.
- Tests are run using [tox][], [pytest][], and some other tools - including 
[safety][], [bandit][], [isort][] and [prospector][]. (You may want to remove 
this test suite and replace it with your own test suite of choice if you have 
your own preference.)

## Some hopefully helpful, pre-configured stuff
The system is not particularly opinionated - but it does come pre-made with the 
tools you'll need to build an API-driven Django & ReactJS application, with 
scheduled background workers. So based on that premise, a set of 
pre-configurations have been made, including some light examples of how to get 
a system like this one running (sending a request from ReactJS to 
Django, for example).

The main pre-configurations are:

* [Django][] is pre-installed with [Django Rest Framework][], which provides the
 facility for you to build public or private API endpoints.
* [Django CORS Headers][] is also pre-installed, which allows you to make 
requests to those endpoints from any decoupled frontend, otherwise the requests 
will be rejected by Django's security mechanisms. You'll need to update the CORS
 settings in `settings.py`if you want to add other hosts.
* An extremely simple Django / DRF app called 'Items' is pre-built - it's a 
tiny model with a read-only DRF API view and serializer that sends a 3-field 
JSON object to a URL for consumption by the front-end.
* A simple ReactJS 'Items' component requests the Items API every 3 seconds from
 the front-end using `fetch`.
* [Celery][] has been pre-installed, which runs on a Worker container - which 
allows you to hand long-running
tasks (or scheduled jobs) to Celery. It uses Redis as a message queue so it can 
handle massive volumes of tasks if needed.
* An example scheduled Celery task has been set up, which can be used as 
a skeleton for future tasks. You can run this on the back-end using 
`make startbeat` once the build is completed, your database has data in it 
(there are fixtures for this) and all of your containers are running. 
This will run the task every 5 seconds, updating the data. The front-end will 
then consume the new data. Real-time data flow!
* Gunicorn serves the application through the `wsgi.py` file in `/backend`
* Nginx serves the project's static files.

The project is designed to mostly be administered through a provided `Makefile` 
in the root directory that provides a number of simple but very convenient 
shortcuts to the most common commands and workflows that we tend to use with 
Django projects. Good news - these commands can be easily extended by adding 
new Make targets specific to your application, following the pattern within the 
Makefile itself.

## The makefile
A [Makefile][] is a file of pre-made CLI commands proxied through the `make` 
command so you have a single, consistent interface by which you can manage 
otherwise unwieldy commands from different software products and services. 
The aforementioned Makefile is included to help make developing your Django 
application faster, simpler and more fun. (Be aware - in some instances, you 
may need to use `sudo make` instead of just calling `make` - because the 
`docker` and `docker-compose` commands occasionally need admin rights, 
depending on what you're doing. If your Make commands fail, despite the syntax 
being correct that might be why.)

The syntax looks like `make [command]` (without the brackets). A full list of 
commands can be found within the Makefile, I highly recommend checking it out!

## Building the system
The simplest way to get this stack of containers working is to use the commands 
in the included Makefile, which will do everything for you. 

After cloning this repository to a fresh directory on your local machine,
the build workflow should be as simple as running 3 commands:

* `make build` (This will build everything and start
all of the containers). It may take some time, so be patient.
* `make firstload` - this will migrate the database, create a Django admin 
user, and prompt you for a password for that user, so you can log into the 
back-end / Django admin system.
* `make loaddata APP=items` - this will load the system with data, through an
attached set of fixtures, so the example app works.

## Using the system
__Checking the front and backends__
* Check that your containers are running. You should have obvious terminal 
output that confirms, this but you can also run `docker ps` - you should have 6
containers running.
* You should then be able to visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/, log in with the
name 'admin' and the password you specified - and then you'll have access to 
the backend.
* You should be able to visit http://127.0.0.1:3000 and see the React front-end.

__Running Celery Beat:__
* A pre-made Celery Beat task is included, which is a scheduled task that 
updates the data on the back-end every few seconds using a simple function. 
The build process intentionally does not start this task automatically because 
the task will start augmenting data right away and you may not want that.
* You can easily start it manually with `make startbeat`. This will immediately 
start a task running on the data that you have previously loaded (and it will 
probably fail if the database is empty).

__Issues getting Docker running__
Sometimes, if you've been working on other containers, Docker will complain 
because your local machine still has containers running that have already 
assigned ports 8000 (Django) and 3000 (ReactJS) locally. If you're getting 
errors that stop these pieces of the build coming up, you'll need to:

* Check your locally running Docker processes using `docker ps`
* Work out which ones are likely hogging the ports
* Gracefully stop the container:
* Or, gracefully stop *all* containers: 

Now, run `docker ps` again. This should show either only the containers you want
running, or none at all, depending on how many you stopped.

__Killing containers__
(If gracefully stopping them doesn't work, you'll need to kill them. I don't 
generally recommend this, but sometimes Docker is awkward and leaves you with
no choice.)

To kill a specific container:
Or, kill all running containers:

Now, run `docker ps` again. This should show either on

#### Going nuclear (take caution)
You almost never need to do this, but if for some reason you want to go nuclear, 
you can run:

`docker system prune -a`

This will remove:

  - *All* stopped containers
  - *All* networks not used by at least one container
  - *All* images without at least one container associated to them
  - *All* build cache
  
(Be aware that you'll need to rebuild *all* of your local Docker containers,
networks and volumes if you choose to do this.)

## Removing things you don't need
You can, of course, rip out any of the stuff you don't need from this starter 
project, and you'll almost certainly want to do that with the Django 'Items' 
app, as well as any dependencies that you don't actually need. You'll just 
need to:

* Remove any of the directories and files that are surplus to requirements
* Update the Django settings file to reflect anything you've removed (Celery 
dictionaries, for example)
* Run `make uninstall PKG=` for any of the dependencies you don't need 
(more details in the Makefile)
* Run `make install PKG=` for any new dependencies you do need 
(more details in the Makefile)
* Run `make piplock` to re-lock your requirements, after you've installed what 
you need

If you don't need a completely decoupled ReactJS front-end, you can just delete 
the entire 'frontend' directory and Docker-Compose service, and set up your 
Django project with either a) A different frontend or b) As a vanilla Django 
project, using your choice of template handler, as per the documentation.

#### Note:
There are a lot of utilities in the Makefile that will cover pretty much
all of the regular Django manage.py developmental workflow stuff you need. It's
written as a simple wrapper around the regular `docker exec` commands - 
but it will save you a lot of typing, so take a look at that for some 
handy shortcuts.

### Alternatively, regular Docker
Alternatively, if you prefer the more traditional Docker commands, you can of course
just use the regular commands, for example:

* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose run --rm djangoapp roguetrader/manage.py migrate`
* `docker-compose run --rm djangoapp hello/manage.py collectstatic --no-input'`

## Running the tests
To run the full test suite, simply run:

- `make runtests`

(This will both install the test suite and run it all.)

Other test utilities are also available:

- `make checksafety` (Checks for security holes or pre-deployment issues.)
- `make checkstyle` (Checks for code style.)
- `make coverage` (Reports code coverage.)

## Predeploy
Before deploying, you can run a `clean` as well as the testsuite by running:

- `make predeploy`

This should clean out your working directory of temporary, cached, or other
unnecessary files, and give you an actionable list of things to take care of 
before redeploying.

Before deployment, as always, make sure to remove your secrets from version 
control (remove the `config` directory from VCS), and only make sure that DB, 
Nginx & Gunicorn settings are set up in production, 
(and stored securely in development).

## Ongoing development
There are lots of ways to improve this repository to make it a strong, generic
starter for API-driven web applications. Any and all ideas are welcome by
creating a new issue, and/or issuing a Pull Request.

We'll also want to make sure that the versions of all of these images, as well
as the major application dependencies (Django, DRF, Celery, ReactJS) are kept
up-to-date, based on the release schedules of these pieces of software.
